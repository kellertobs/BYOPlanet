# BYOPlanet
Planetary accretion disk model for demonstration purposes.

Open Matlab Live Script in Matlab R2023a or later and follow the instructions.

The model solves Newtonian mechanics of an N-body problem by conserving mass and momentum. It approximates collisions and compositional evolution (metal+rock+ice) in a simplified manner to produce an accessible and efficient model suited to demonstration purposes only.

To run the model using a Live Script interactive interface by opening byoplanet.mlx from the /usr directory and following instructions therein.

The model can also be run from a standard script using run_demo.m from /usr as a starting point.

Model developed and distributed by Tobias Keller, University of Glasgow, 2019.
